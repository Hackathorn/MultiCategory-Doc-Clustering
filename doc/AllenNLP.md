# AllenNLP by Allen Institute for AI

## overview
*...an open-source library for building deep learning models for natural language processing, built on top of PyTorch, provides high-level abstractions, and provides an extensible framework that makes it easy to run and manage NLP experiments*
> BUT what does NLP functions does it support?

- See [Guide TOC](https://guide.allennlp.org/overview#4) 

> Seems like a solid framework for NLP ala 2020-2021 but lacks the newer Transformator functionality. 

> No mention of HuggingFace except in github README:  
*If you want to vectorize text, try the [HF transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).*

> In summary... Good solid effort but in need of a major extension. Seems like this group knows that it being left-behind as implied by its vague future plans. Have placed a Watch on their github.
